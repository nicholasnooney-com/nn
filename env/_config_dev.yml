# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Development Settings Override
# These are used to override settings placed in the regular _config.yml.

# Use the local URL. Note that these settings match the $SERVER_ADDR and
# $SERVER_PORT from _rake_config.rb located in this directory.

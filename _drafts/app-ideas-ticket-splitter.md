### Introduction

I was out one day with a group of friends eating at a restaurant called _Ye Old
Forge_, a place we frequently visit because some of our group are trying to
complete a beer card offered there. It's a nice time, except when it comes to
the bill. _Ye Old Forge_ can only split a check three ways. And there are more
than three of us dining together.

One way to solve the bill is usually to pair us off and split the bill based
upon each set of items the pairs order. We don't split the bill evenly amongst
everyone because not all of us order drinks while at the restaurant. We don't
want to burden our non-drinkers with the extra cost of our drinks.

Thus we came up with `Ticket Splitter`. Ticket splitter is an app that will
allow you to take a picture of a receipt and split its items amongst the members
of your party, or adhering to the rules of the establishment you choose to eat
at.

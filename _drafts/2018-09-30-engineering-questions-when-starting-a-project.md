A good project answers a variety of questions designed to help support specific
events that may arise during the course of a project. As with any good research,
I attempt to define the questions first, then look at other projects which may
have answered these questions to provide a variety of solutions.

### How to Get Started: Transform an Idea into a Prototype

This series of questions will help transform an idea into a prototype design.
The more prepared answers you have to these questions, then the more prepared
the application will be to evolve after the first prototype.

#### 1. What do you want to do? (Developing Requirements)

The first thing I find helpful is organizing what goals the application should
accomplish. Corportations spend millions investing in mission statements to
organize what their business goals are. Large software meticulously maintains a
set of requirements that can be used to measure conformity to the stated goals.
All of these goals and requirements usually support the core idea. These systems
are probably more complex than a small hobby project, but a simple bulleted list
of the key points that the program will accomplish will help define the scope of
the project and will be used to define criteria for determining if these goals
are met. The key point when writing these goals is to establish a _scope_ for
what you will accomplish.

In agile projects, goals are establish through the use of user stories.

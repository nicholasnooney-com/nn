Back in the golden age of Divenon, when the seven kingdoms operated in harmony,
when trade flourished and travel was safe, back when families were whole and no
one had want of food or comfort, those were the days my parents dream about.

"It was a simpler time then", they would tell me as I was falling asleep in the
only bed in our hovel, the width of a twin but only half as long. "We used to
live in a proper home, with a beautiful den and a grand dining table. You would
love all the light that came in through the windows. The whole place would glow
with sunlight, and you could fall asleep in its warmth."

I know they protect me from the outside world with the stories they tell me
about their childhood, but I know nothing of the past. The only world I know is
the one I was born into, encompassed by the four clay walls of this dwelling
and the ancient oak tree sitting alone in the grassy field outside the small
opening above the wooden counter which my mother prepares all our meals. I have
never felt the warmth of the sunlight.

I try to imagine what it feels like to be outside, sitting under the oak and
reading a book. The book I would read would be an adventure about Peter West, a
fearless and courageous hero who would fight for the Frigori and destroy the
tzar in his palace on Intempilla. Its pages would be filled with excitement,
unlike the only book we have now: _Divenon's Complete History_. I know that this
book can't be complete like it's title says, since none of the stories my
parents tell me are mentioned anywhere inside it. But I don't know that I can
trust my parents' stories either, because they refuse to let me go outside.

"It's too dangerous," they tell me each time I ask them. And when I point out
that they leave our hovel, they say, "It's only so we can pick up food and items
we need at the trading post." I used to ask if I could go with them, but they
would end up right back at stage one, "It's too dangerous." It's too unfair.

So I fall asleep to the sound of my mother's voice, nostalgic for the golden
days, and I begin to dream about the world outside of the small hole 

# Future Points

- One day smoke is billowing in the background of the oak tree. Seeing it causes
  the family to retreat from the already advancing front.

# Atlas and Brief History

- Divenon "Two Veins" - In the Ancient times was called Caeglebeus
  "Land made of Sky" or "Sky made of Land"
  - Boreapont "Northern Sea"
    - Taleamaghi - In the Golden Age was called Altomeraviglia
      The Ruined Northern Kingdom, now largely a swampland. A city of great
      magic and power over the Boreapont. They brought a severe winter upon the
      golden fields in central Divenon in response to Intempilla's claim to
      power at the start of the Great War. As a result of this action, the
      entire kingdom was destroyed by Intempilla and the rest of the Vespelagian
      kingdoms.
    - Frigoris
      The Frozen Southern Kingdom, protected by giant ice spikes. Traveling to
      this kingdom is difficult and dangerous; the safest way is to travel along
      the river from the north or the west. The Frigori provided the majority of
      strength for the Boreapont, and their forces fight in the lands west of
      Frigoris to this day. The main character is from a small town in the
      region under the protection of Frigoris.
  - Vespelago "Western Sea"
    - Intempilla - In the Golden Age was called Potissilla
      The Dark Island, current seat of power in Divenon. The fortified island
      once served as the capital kingdom in Divenon, where royalty from each of
      the six kingdoms would negotiate and trade. It's highest leader was the
      general of the Divenon Armed Forces, commanding soldiers from all of the
      six kingdoms. General __ began the Great War when he took as prisoners
      five of the six kings.

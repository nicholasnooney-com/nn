    This series of posts details the process I completed to design the theme for
    this site. I began exploring how gem-based themes work and build a working
    theme that contains feature-parity with Minima, Jekyll's default theme. I
    then move on to add more advanced content, including supporting a series of
    posts, adding Code Syntax Highlighting, and other features to complement the
    theme of this site. As I update the theme, I will add more posts to this
    series. You can always grab the latest copy of this theme's code at GitHub.

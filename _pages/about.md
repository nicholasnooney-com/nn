My name is Nicholas Nooney. I have a background in Mathematics and Computer
Science, and a passion for learning. I've worked with the following
technologies:

- `C, C++`
    - I work with C/C++ daily. I've worked on application and infrastructure
      software at General Dynamics Mission Systems. I've also written test
      drivers and programs to certify hardware interfaces.
    - At St. Olaf College, I wrote a C++ program to emulate the basic features
      of the 2001 GameBoy Advance game _Advance Wars_. It uses OpenGL to render
      graphics. The program is called `Pixel Wars` and you can view it
      [here][pixel wars].
- `Python`
    - I've implemented a PyQt based program for work that performs configuration
      management functions for development objects. It uses peewee to interface
      with a SQL database, manages files with libgit and pygit2. To help with
      maintainability, the code base uses pytest and pylint.
    - Using Natural Language Processing via SpaCy, I helped author a program
      that evaluates propositional logic in the English language. Given a series
      of statements and a conclusion, it will determine the validity (Confirmed,
      Plausible, or Busted) of the conclusion based solely upon the statements.
      The program is called `Project-e.a.s.t.` and you can view it
      [here][project-east].
- `JavaScript`
    - I've written small applications in vanilla JavaScript, including an
      interactive backdrop for a student theater performance called _In Black_,
      and a website to collect data for a psychology class project.
- `Ruby`
    - I've picked up portions of Ruby in order to take advantage of the full
      capabilities that Jekyll has to offer. I've written a Rakefile to manage
      common tasks for my site, including setting up the continuous deployment
      pipeline. I've also developed a custom plugin for my site in order to
      group related content together and display a summary page. This plugin is
      similar to `jekyll-archives`, but is a bit more flexible and suited to my
      needs for this site.
- `Bash`
    - Bash scripting allows for simple automation of routine tasks. I've mostly
      developed scripts to help automate my work environment, including
      automatically recording data required to perform an Assured File Transfer
      in compliance with DSS guidelines. I've also written scripts to obtain
      build version info for software and manage various build environments.
- `SQL`
    - I helped design and implement a Schema for the Python PyQt based program
      mentioned above. I've also written custom queries to identify items in our
      CR database at work, as well as in JIRA to handle finding specific tasks.

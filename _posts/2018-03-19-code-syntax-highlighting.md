One aspect of this static site that was looking bland was the code snippets
first presented in [Customizing This Site][post-link]. Originally, these
snippets were presented as black text on a grey background. To improve the
visual appearance of code blocks, I decided to add code syntax highlighting
with [Nord][nord-link].
